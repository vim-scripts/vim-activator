There's a script that comes with vim distribution for editing with existing
vim in Windows.  However, this feature doesn't work in Linux xterm
environment.  There's a beast called Vim Shell by Thomas Wana, but it's not
officially endorsed by vim.  When you exit vim to shell by pressing <ctrl-z>
which suspends the vim, this nifty little gadget allows you edit subsequent
files by reusing the existing vim.  It's kind of emulates a vim shell from the
view point of a normal user.  This tool requires client-server option to be
enabled in vim.
